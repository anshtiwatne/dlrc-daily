Theatre! What an art form. It can speak the unspoken and show what us everyday people cannot see! The twirl of a hand, a subtle frown, can say so much more than words can tell! An art so graceful that it demands a whole day to itself, to spread its talents with others, and to let people know that it is so much more than just show business. And to do just that, the World Theatre Day is celebrated every year on 27th March, by people all around the globe.
